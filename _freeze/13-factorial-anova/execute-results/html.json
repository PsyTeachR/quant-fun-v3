These are flexible models where you have one independent variable (IV) with three or more levels. They get you a long way but sometimes your research question and design calls for multiple IVs or factors. \n\nIn this chapter, we extend the ANOVA framework to include two or more IVs/factors and their interaction. We will show you how to run a factorial ANOVA using the <pkg>afex</pkg> package and break down interactions through post-hoc tests using the <pkg>emmeans</pkg> package. Visualising your data is particularly important for understanding interactions, so we put a lot of emphasis on data visualisation through violin-boxplots and interaction plots. \n\n**Chapter Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)**\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n\n- Apply and interpret a factorial ANOVA. \n\n- Break down the results of a factorial ANOVA using post-hocs tests and apply a correction for multiple comparisons.\n\n- Check statistical assumptions for factorial ANOVA through your understanding of the design and diagnostic plots. \n\n- Visualise the results of a factorial ANOVA through an interaction plot. \n\n## Chapter preparation\n\n### Introduction to the data set \n\nFor this chapter, we are using open data from experiment 3 in @zhang_present_2014 which you might remember from Chapter 7. Now you have developed your inferential skills, we can return to reproduce their analyses. The abstract of their article is:\n\n> Although documenting everyday activities may seem trivial, four studies reveal that creating records of the present generates unexpected benefits by allowing future rediscoveries. In Study 1, we used a time-capsule paradigm to show that individuals underestimate the extent to which rediscovering experiences from the past will be curiosity provoking and interesting in the future. In Studies 2 and 3, we found that people are particularly likely to underestimate the pleasure of rediscovering ordinary, mundane experiences, as opposed to extraordinary experiences. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that underestimating the pleasure of rediscovery leads to time-inconsistent choices: Individuals forgo opportunities to document the present but then prefer rediscovering those moments in the future to engaging in an alternative fun activity. Underestimating the value of rediscovery is linked to peopleâ€™s erroneous faith in their memory of everyday events. By documenting the present, people provide themselves with the opportunity to rediscover mundane moments that may otherwise have been forgotten.\n\nIn summary, they were interested in whether people could predict how interested they would be in rediscovering past experiences. They call it a \"time capsule\" effect, where people store photos or messages to remind themselves of past events in the future. They predicted participants in the ordinary group would underestimate their future feelings (i.e., there would be a bigger difference between time 1 and time 2 measures) compared to participants in the extraordinary group.\n\nNow we are focusing on the analysis rather than just visualisation, we can describe the experiment as a 2 x 2 mixed design. The first IV is time (time1, time2) and is within-subjects. The second IV is type of event (ordinary vs. extraordinary) and is a between-subjects factor. We will then use interest as a DV for a composite measure which took the mean of items on interest, meaningfulness, and enjoyment\n\n### Organising your files and project for the chapter\n\nBefore we can get started, you need to organise your files and project for the chapter, so your working directory is in order.\n\n1. In your folder for research methods and the book `ResearchMethods1_2/Quant_Fundamentals`, create a new folder called `Chapter_13_F_ANOVA`. Within `Chapter_13_F_ANOVA`, create two new folders called `data` and `figures`.\n\n2. Create an R Project for `Chapter_13_F_ANOVA` as an existing directory for your chapter folder. This should now be your working directory.\n\n3. Create a new R Markdown document and give it a sensible title describing the chapter, such as `13 Factorial ANOVA`. Delete everything below line 10 so you have a blank file to work with and save the file in your `Chapter_13_F_ANOVA` folder. \n\n4. If you must download the data again, please save the following file: [Zhang_2014.csv](data/Zhang_2014.csv). Right click the link and select \"save link as\", or clicking the link will save the files to your Downloads. Make sure that you save the file as \".csv\". Save or copy the file to your `data/` folder within `Chapter_13_F_ANOVA`.\n\nYou are now ready to start working on the chapter! \n\n### Activity 1 - Load the packages and read the data\n\nWe already worked on the data wrangling in Chapter 7, so please type or copy and paste the following code to prepare for the chapter. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the packages below\n#library(\"rcompanion\")\nlibrary(effectsize)\n#library(\"car\")\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(afex)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\n\n# Load the data file\n# This should be the Zhang_2014.csv file \nzhang_data <- read_csv(\"data/Zhang_2014.csv\")\n\n# Wrangle the data for plotting. \n# select and rename key variables\n# mutate to add participant ID and recode\nzhang_wide <- zhang_data %>%\n  select(Gender, \n         Age, \n         Condition, \n         time1_interest = T1_Predicted_Interest_Composite, \n         time2_interest = T2_Actual_Interest_Composite) %>%\n  mutate(participant_ID = row_number(),\n         Condition = case_match(Condition, \n                            1 ~ \"Ordinary\", \n                            2 ~ \"Extraordinary\"))\n\nzhang_long <- zhang_wide %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = time1_interest:time2_interest,\n               names_to = \"Time\",\n               values_to = \"Interest\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor different functions, we need the data in wide- or long-format, so we have two versions of the data prepared for the chapter. Pay careful attention to when you need one version or the other. \n\n### Activity 2 - Calculate descriptive statistics {#factorial-a2}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\nBefore we start on the inferential statistics, one key part of understanding your data and reporting for context in a report is calculating descriptive statistics like the mean and standard deviation. \n\nFor the combination of `Condition` and `Time`, calculate the mean and standard deviation of `Interest`. We will need this at the end of the chapter, so save your results to the object name `zhang_descriptives`. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nzhang_descriptives <- zhang_long %>%\n  group_by(Condition, Time) %>%\n  summarise(mean = round(mean(Interest, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n            sd = round(sd(Interest, na.rm = TRUE), 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Condition'.

Look up the help documentation for `aov_ez` if you need further information. \n\n### Activity 4 - Using the `aov_ez()` function. \n\nBefore we show you the code, try and complete the following skeleton version first. Think about what variable in the data corresponds to each argument. \n\nSave the ANOVA model to an object called `mod_factorial` to be consistent with explanations below.

The DV is interval or ratio data.\n\n2. The observations should be independent.\n\n3. The residuals should be normally distributed.\n\n4. There should be homogeneity of variance between the groups.\n\nAs before, we know assumption 2 is met from the design of the study. Assumption 1 throws up an interesting issue which is the problem of ordinal data. Ordinal data are the kind of data that come from Likert scales and are very common in psychology. The problem is that ordinal data are not interval or ratio data, there's a fixed number of integer values they can take (the values of the Likert scale) and you cannot claim that the distance between the values is equal (is the difference between strongly agree and agree the same as the difference between agree and neutral?). \n\nTechnically, we should not use an ANOVA to analyse ordinal data - *but almost everyone does*. Many people argue that if you take the average of multiple Likert scale items, you can interpret the data as if they are interval and they can be normally distributed. Other people argue you should use non-parametric methods or more complex models such as ordinal regression for this type of data, but it is beyond the scope of what we cover in this course (if you are super interested, there is a PsyTeachR book for another course - [Statistics and Research Design](https://bartlettje.github.io/statsresdesign/introduction-to-generalised-linear-models.html){target=\"_blank\"} - which covers ordinal regression). Whichever route you choose, you should understand the data you have and you should be able to justify your decision.\n\nTo test assumption 3, you can run `check_model()` from <pkg>performance</pkg> on the model object (`mod_factorial`). Unless you add the argument `re_formula = NA`, you get a little warning saying the function does it anyway. The background of this argument is beyond the scope of this course, but expressed as a linear model, a mixed ANOVA looks like something called a mixed-effects model, so this argument is saying that there is not a formula for it, since we did not have one. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_model(mod_factorial, \n            re_formula = NA) # Specify or you get a warning \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-factorial-anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDoes it look like we have any obvious problems with normality here? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Yes</option><option value='answer'>No</option></select>\n\nThe one annoying thing here is we do not get a diagnostic plot for checking homogeneity of variance / homoscedasticity. We can create our own using the lm component of the model object (`mod_factorial$lm`), but it takes a few steps. In the code below: \n\n- We first isolate the standardised residuals of the model object. We must convert it to a data frame and rename the two columns. \n\n- We combine the residuals with the wide version of the data. \n\n- We pivot the data longer so all the residuals are in one column and create a new variable to take the square root of the absolute residuals. This recreates how the diagnostic plots you saw in Chapters 8, 9, and 12 look. \n\n- Finally, we plot the standardised residuals and add a line to join the means of each group. If the line is roughly flat, we support homoscedasticity. If the line angles up or down substantially, then this points to signs of heteroscedasticity. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Isolate standardised residuals as a data frame\nresiduals <- as.data.frame(rstandard(mod_factorial$lm)) %>% \n  select(residuals_time1 = time1_interest,\n         residuals_time2 = time2_interest)\n\n# add residuals to the wide version of the data, so we have the groups\nzhang_wide <- zhang_wide %>% \n  bind_cols(residuals)\n\n# Pivot longer and calculate the square root of absolute standardised residuals\nresiduals_long <- zhang_wide %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = residuals_time1:residuals_time2, \n               names_to = \"Time\", \n               values_to = \"Residuals\") %>% \n  mutate(std_residuals = sqrt(abs(Residuals)))\n\n# Plot the residuals\nresiduals_long %>%\n  # we need groups as numbers for the line to plot \n  mutate(Condition = case_match(Condition,\n                                \"Ordinary\" ~ 1,\n                                \"Extraordinary\" ~ 2)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Condition, y = std_residuals)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  # add line joining the mean of residuals per group\n  stat_summary(geom = \"line\", \n               fun = mean, \n               color = \"blue\", \n               linewidth = 1.5) + \n    labs(x = \"Condition\", y = \"Standardised Residuals\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-factorial-anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDoes it look like we have any obvious problems with homoscedasticity here? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Yes</option><option value='answer'>No</option></select>\n\n### Activity 6 - Post-hoc tests {#factorial-a6}\n\nBecause the interaction is significant, we should follow this up with post-hoc tests using `emmeans()` to determine which comparisons are significant. If the overall interaction is not significant, you should not conduct additional tests.\n\n`emmeans()` requires you to specify the `aov` object, and then the factors you want to contrast. For an interaction, we use the notation `pairwise ~ IV1 | IV2` and you specify which multiple comparison correction you want to apply.\n\nRun the below code and view the results. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run the tests\nposthoc_factorial <- emmeans(mod_factorial, \n                             pairwise ~ Time | Condition, \n                             adjust = \"bonferroni\")\n\nposthoc_factorial\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$emmeans\nCondition = Extraordinary:\n Time           emmean    SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n time1_interest   4.36 0.137 128     4.09     4.63\n time2_interest   4.65 0.147 128     4.36     4.94\n\nCondition = Ordinary:\n Time           emmean    SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n time1_interest   4.04 0.139 128     3.76     4.31\n time2_interest   4.73 0.149 128     4.44     5.03\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n$contrasts\nCondition = Extraordinary:\n contrast                        estimate    SE  df t.ratio p.value\n time1_interest - time2_interest   -0.288 0.136 128  -2.123  0.0357\n\nCondition = Ordinary:\n contrast                        estimate    SE  df t.ratio p.value\n time1_interest - time2_interest   -0.695 0.138 128  -5.049  <.0001\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the output, we first get the estimated marginal means for the combination of IVs.

This is essentially a line graph where the x-axis has one IV and separate lines for a second IV. However, once you have the factorial ANOVA model, you can add confidence intervals to the plot to visualise uncertainty. <pkg>afex</pkg> has it's own function called `afex_plot()` which you can use with the model object you created. \n\nIn the code below, there are a few key argument to highlight: \n\n- `object` is the <pkg>afex</pkg> model you created. \n\n- `x` is the variable you want on the x-axis. \n\n- `trace` is the variable you want to plot as separate lines. \n\n- `error` controls whether the error bars show confidence intervals for between-subjects or within-subjects. In a mixed design, these have different properties, so you must think about which you want to plot and highlight to the reader. \n\n- `factor_levels` lets you edit the levels of factors you plot, such as renaming or reordering them. You add each factor into a list but check the documentation and vignettes for other options. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nafex_plot(object = mod_factorial, \n          x = \"Condition\", \n          trace = \"Time\", \n          error = \"between\",\n          factor_levels = list(Time = c(\"Time 1\", \"Time 2\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-factorial-anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne handy feature about this function is it uses <pkg>ggplot2</pkg> in the background, so you can add layers to the initial function like other plots that you have created. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nafex_plot(mod_factorial, \n          x = \"Condition\", \n          trace = \"Time\", \n          error = \"between\",\n          factor_levels = list(Time = c(\"Time 1\", \"Time 2\"))) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-factorial-anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSince `afex_plot()` uses <pkg>ggplot2</pkg>, you can use `ggsave()` to save your plots and insert them into your work. \n:::\n\n## Reporting the results of your factorial ANOVA {#factorial-a8}\n\nNow you have all your values, we can work on the write-up of your results. \n\nIn the in-line code demonstration below, we manually entered *p*-values where they are < .001. There is a way to get R to produce this formatting but it's overly complicated for our purposes in this course. If you want to push yourself, look up the [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja){target=\"_blank\"} package for creating reproducible manuscripts. \n\nThe values of partial eta-squared do not match between our analysis and those reported in the paper. We have not figured out why this is yet, so if you know, please get in touch!\n\nWe have also replaced the simple effects in the main paper with our pairwise comparisons. \n\nCopy and paste the text and inline code below into **white-space** in your R Markdown document. If you saved all the descriptives, model, and contrasts using the same object names as us, this should knit. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWe conducted the same repeated measures ANOVA with interest as the dependent measure and again found a main effect of time, F(`r factorial_output$num.Df[2]`, `r factorial_output$den.Df[2]`) = `r factorial_output$statistic[2] %>% round(2)`, p < .001, Î·p2 = `r factorial_output$ges[2] %>% round(3)`; anticipated interest at Time 1 (M = `r zhang_descriptives$mean[1] %>% round(2)`), SD = `r zhang_descriptives$sd[1]%>% round(2)`)) was lower than actual interest at Time 2 (M = `r zhang_descriptives$mean[2]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r zhang_descriptives$sd[2]%>% round(2)`). We also observed an interaction between time and type of experience, F(`r factorial_output$num.Df[3]`, `r factorial_output$den.Df[3]`) = `r factorial_output$statistic[3] %>% round(3)`, p = `r factorial_output$p.value[3] %>% round(2)`, Î·p2 = `r factorial_output$ges[3] %>% round(3)`. Pairwise comparisons revealed that for ordinary events, predicted interest at Time 1 (M = `r zhang_descriptives$mean[3]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r zhang_descriptives$sd[3]%>% round(2)`) was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 (M = `r zhang_descriptives$mean[4]%>% round(2)`, SD = `r zhang_descriptives$sd[4]%>% round(2)`), t(`r contrasts_factorial$df[2]%>% round(2)`) = `r contrasts_factorial$statistic[2]%>% round(2)`, p < .001, d = `r contrasts_factorial$Cohens_d[2]%>% round(2)`.

We also observed an interaction between time and type of experience, F(1, 128) = 4.445, p = 0.04, Î·p2 = 0.008. Pairwise comparisons revealed that for ordinary events, predicted interest at Time 1 (M = 4.04, SD = 1.09) was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 (M = 4.73, SD = 1.24), t(128) = -5.05, p < .001, d = -0.56. Although predicted interest for extraordinary events at Time 1 (M = 4.36, SD = 1.13) was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 (M = 4.65, SD = 1.14), t(128) = -2.12, p < .001, d = -0.31, the magnitude of underestimation was smaller than for ordinary events.\n\n## End of Chapter\n\nWell done, you have now covered the ANOVA section of the course to learn how to express experimental designs into statistical models. ANOVA and factorial ANOVA are incredibly flexible tools where you can start to combine multiple independent variables. You might have between-subject factors, within-subject factors, or a combination of the two in a mixed design. The most important thing to keep in mind is your research question, hypothesis, and design come first. Factorial ANOVA can get arbitrarily more complicated but try and avoid the temptation to create complex models just because you can. You do not get extra points for complication, it is better to think about which model will let you address your research question. \n\nIn the next chapter, we finish the core chapters on the final extension of the general linear model we cover in this course. In Research Methods 1, you learnt about simple linear regression when you only have one predictor. In multiple linear regression, you can add two or more predictors, and even the interaction between predictors. \n",
