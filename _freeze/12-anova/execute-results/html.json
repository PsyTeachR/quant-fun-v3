You should be familiar with all the content from Research Methods 1 we covered in Chapters 1 to 11, so please revisit previous chapters if you need a refresher. \n\nIn the course materials, you have worked through manually calculating an ANOVA to gain a conceptual understanding. However, when you run an ANOVA, typically the computer does all of these calculations for you. In this chapter, we will show you how to run a one-way ANOVA using the <pkg>afex</pkg> package and post-hoc tests using the <pkg>emmeans</pkg> package. \n\n**Chapter Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)**\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n\n- Apply and interpret a one-way ANOVA. \n\n- Break down the results of a one-way ANOVA using post-hocs tests and apply a correction for multiple comparisons.\n\n- Conduct a power analysis for a one-way ANOVA. \n\n## Chapter preparation\n\n### Introduction to the data set \n\nFor this chapter, we are using open data from experiment 2 in @james_computer_2015. The abstract of their article is:\n\n> Memory of a traumatic event becomes consolidated within hours. Intrusive memories can then flash back repeatedly into the mind's eye and cause distress. We investigated whether reconsolidation - the process during which memories become malleable when recalled - can be blocked using a cognitive task and whether such an approach can reduce these unbidden intrusions. We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms. A simple, non-invasive cognitive-task procedure administered after emotional memory has already consolidated (i.e., > 24 hours after exposure to experimental trauma) may prevent the recurrence of intrusive memories of those emotional events.\n\nIn summary, they were interested in whether you can reduce intrusive memories associated with a traumatic event. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four groups and watched a video designed to be traumatic: \n\n1. Control\n\n2. Reactivation + Tetris\n\n3. Tetris\n\n4. Reactivation\n\nThey measured the number of intrusive memories prior to the start of the study, then participants kept a diary to record intrusive memories about the film in the 7 days after watching it. The authors were interested in whether the combination of reactivation and playing Tetris would lead to the largest reduction in intrusive memories. You will recreate their analyses using a one-way ANOVA. \n\n### Organising your files and project for the chapter\n\nBefore we can get started, you need to organise your files and project for the chapter, so your working directory is in order.\n\n1. In your folder for research methods and the book `ResearchMethods1_2/Quant_Fundamentals`, create a new folder called `Chapter_12_ANOVA`. Within `Chapter_12_ANOVA`, create two new folders called `data` and `figures`.\n\n2. Create an R Project for `Chapter_12_ANOVA` as an existing directory for your chapter folder. This should now be your working directory.\n\n3. Create a new R Markdown document and give it a sensible title describing the chapter, such as `12 ANOVA`. Delete everything below line 10 so you have a blank file to work with and save the file in your `Chapter_12_ANOVA` folder. \n\n4. We are working with a new data set, so please save the following data file: [James_2015.csv](data/James_2015.csv). Right click the link and select \"save link as\", or clicking the link will save the files to your Downloads. Make sure that you save the file as \".csv\". Save or copy the file to your `data/` folder within `Chapter_12_ANOVA`.\n\nYou are now ready to start working on the chapter! \n\n### Activity 1 - Read and wrangle the data\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nAs the first activity, try and test yourself by completing the following task list to practice your data wrangling skills. Create a final object called `james_data` to be consistent with the tasks below. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\nTo wrangle the data, complete the following tasks: \n\n1. Load the following packages (several of these are new, so revisit [Chapter 1](#install-tidy) if you need a refresher of installing R packages, but remember not to install packages on the university computers / online server):\n\n    - <pkg>pwr</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>effectsize</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>broom</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>afex</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>emmeans</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>performance</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>tidyverse</pkg>\n\n2. Read the data file `data/James_2015.csv` to the object name `james_data`.\n\n3. Create a new variable called `PID` that equals `row_number()` to act as a participant ID which is currently missing from the data set. \n\n4. Convert `Condition` to a factor. \n\n5. Select and rename the following three variables as we do not need the others: \n\n    - `PID`\n    \n    - `Condition`\n    \n    - Rename `Days_One_to_Seven_Image_Based_Intrusions_in_Intrusion_Diary` to `intrusions`.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(pwr)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(afex)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read data and add new column\njames_data <- read_csv(\"data/James_2015.csv\") %>%\n  mutate(PID = row_number(),\n         Condition = as.factor(Condition)) %>% \n  select(PID, \n         Condition, \n         intrusions = Days_One_to_Seven_Image_Based_Intrusions_in_Intrusion_Diary)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 2 - Create summary statistics {#anova-a4}\n\nNext, we want to calculate some descriptive statistics to see some overall trends in the data. We are really interested in the scores from each experimental group rather than overall.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\n- Summarise the data to show the mean, standard deviation, and standard error for the number of intrusive memories (`intrusions`) grouped by `Condition`. \n\n- Your table should have four columns, `Condition`, `mean`, `sd`, and `se`. \n\nHint: You can calculate the standard error through: `sd/sqrt(n)` or `sd/sqrt(length(some_variable_name)`. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njames_data %>%\n  group_by(Condition) %>%\n  summarise(mean = round(mean(intrusions), 2), \n            sd = round(sd(intrusions), 2), \n            se = round(sd/sqrt(length(intrusions)), 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|Condition | mean|   sd|   se|\n|:---------|----:|----:|----:|\n|1         | 5.11| 4.23| 1.00|\n|2         | 1.89| 1.75| 0.41|\n|3         | 3.89| 2.89| 0.68|\n|4         | 4.83| 3.33| 0.78|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 3 - Visualisation {#anova-a5}\n\nNow we can visualise the data. In the original paper they use a bar plot, but let's use a better plot that gives us more information about the data. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\n- Create a violin-boxplot with the number of intrusive memories on the y-axis and condition on the x-axis (See Chapter 7 if you need a reminder). \n\n- Change the labels on the x-axis to something more informative for the condition names. \n\nYour plot should look like this: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njames_data %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Condition, y = intrusions))+\n  geom_violin()+\n  geom_boxplot(width = .2) + \n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Number of Intrusions\") + \n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"Control\", \"Reactivation + Tetris\", \"Tetris\", \"Reactivation\")) + \n  theme_classic()\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can see from this plot that there are a few potential outliers in each of the groups. This information is not present in the bar plot, which is why it's not a good idea to use them for this kind of data. \n:::\n\n## One-way ANOVA {#anova-a6}\n\nNow we can run the one-way ANOVA using `aov_ez()` from the <pkg>afex</pkg> package and save it to the object `mod`. As well as running the ANOVA, the `aov_ez()` function also conducts a Levene's test for homogeneity of variance so that we can test our final assumption.\n\n### Activity 4 - Running a one-way ANOVA using afex\n\n`aov_ez()` will likely produce some messages that look like errors, do not worry about these, they are just letting you know what it's done. Run the code below to view the results of the ANOVA.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod <- aov_ez(id = \"PID\", # the column containing the participant IDs\n              dv = \"intrusions\", # the DV \n              between = \"Condition\", # the between-subject variable\n              es = \"pes\", # sets effect size to partial eta-squared\n              type = 3, # this affects how the sum of squares is calculated, set this to 3\n              include_aov = TRUE,\n              data = james_data)\n\nmod\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnova Table (Type 3 tests)\n\nResponse: intrusions\n     Effect    df   MSE      F  ges p.value\n1 Condition 3, 68 10.09 3.79 * .143    .014\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '+' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJust like with the t-tests and correlations, we can use `tidy()` to make the output easier to work with. Run the below code to transform the output. Do not worry about the warning message, it is just telling you it does not know how to automatically rename the columns so it will keep the original names.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod_output <- mod$anova_table %>% \n  tidy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in tidy.anova(.): The following column names in ANOVA output were not\nrecognized or transformed: num.Df, den.Df, MSE, ges\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod_output\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|term      | num.Df| den.Df|      MSE| statistic|       ges|   p.value|\n|:---------|------:|------:|--------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|\n|Condition |      3|     68| 10.08578|  3.794762| 0.1434073| 0.0140858|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\n* `term` = the IV  \n* `num.Df` = degrees of freedom effect\n* `den.Df` = degrees of freedom residuals\n* `MSE` = Mean-squared errors\n* `statistic` = F-statistic\n* `ges` = effect size  \n* `p.value` = p.value\n\nYou should refer to the lecture for more information on what each variable means and how it is calculated.\n\n- Is the overall effect of Condition significant? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Yes</option><option value=''>No</option></select>\n\n- What is the F-statistics to 2 decimal places? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='4' data-answer='[\"3.79\"]'/>\n\n- According to the rules of thumb, the effect size is <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Small</option><option value=''>Medium</option><option value='answer'>Large</option></select>\n\n### Activity 5 - Checking assumptions for ANOVA {#anova-a7}\n\nTo test the assumptions, we must use the model we created with `aov_ez()`. For a one-way independent ANOVA, the assumptions are the same as for a Student t-test / regression model with a categorical predictor:\n\n1. The DV is interval or ratio data.\n\n2. The observations should be independent.\n\n3. The residuals should be normally distributed.\n\n4. There should be homogeneity of variance between the groups.\n\nWe know that 1 and 2 are met because of the design of our study. To test 3, we can look at the qq-plot of the residuals. Instead of saving just the model object, we must specifically select the `aov` component and run our diagnostic plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mod$aov, \n     which = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![qq-plot for model residuals.](12-anova_files/figure-html/fig-qq-1.png){#fig-qq fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe qq-plot shows the assumption of normality might not be ideal. Is this a problem? If the sample sizes for each group are equal, then ANOVA is robust to violations of both normality and of homogeneity of variance. If you are interested, there is a good discussion of these issues in @blanca_effect_2018 and @knief_violating_2021. We can check how many participants are in each condition using `count()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njames_data %>% \n  count(Condition)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|Condition |  n|\n|:---------|--:|\n|1         | 18|\n|2         | 18|\n|3         | 18|\n|4         | 18|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThankfully, the sample sizes are equal, so we should be OK to proceed with the ANOVA. It is not clear whether normality was checked in the original paper.\n\nFor the last assumption, we can test homogeneity of variance by checking the third diagnostic plot for the scale against location. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mod$aov, \n     which = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagnostic plot for homogeneity of variance.](12-anova_files/figure-html/fig-homogeneity-1.png){#fig-homogeneity fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCompared to normality, this assumption looks closer to being supported as the variance of each group is approximately equal. @james_computer_2015 suspect there might be issues with this assumption as they mention that the ANOVAs do not assume equal variance, however, the results of the ANOVA that are reported are identical to our results above where no correction has been made although the post-hoc tests are Welch t-tests (you can tell this because the degrees of freedom have been adjusted and are not whole numbers).\n\nWhile all of this might seem very confusing - we imagine you might be wondering what the point of assumption testing is given that it seems to be ignored - we are showing you this for three reasons: \n\n1. To reassure you that sometimes the data can fail to meet the assumptions and it is still ok to use the test. To put this in statistical terms, many tests are **robust** to mild deviations of normality and unequal variance, particularly with equal sample sizes. \n\n2. As a critical thinking point, to remind you that just because a piece of research has been published does not mean it is perfect and you should always evaluate whether the methods used are appropriate. \n\n3. To reinforce the importance of pre-registration where these decisions could be made in advance, and/or open data and code so that analyses can be reproduced exactly to avoid any ambiguity about exactly what was done. In this example, given the equal sample sizes and the difference in variance between the groups isn't too extreme, it looks like it is still  appropriate to use an ANOVA but the decisions and justification for those decisions could have been more transparent.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe `check_model()` function from <pkg>performance</pkg> also works here, so you can see what it looks like if you run:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_model(mod$aov)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 6 - Post-hoc tests {#anova-a8}\n\nFor post-hoc comparisons, the paper appears to have computed Welch t-tests but there is no mention of any multiple comparison correction. We could reproduce these results by using `t.test()` for each of the contrasts.\n\nFor example, to compare condition 1 (the control group) with condition 2 (the reactivation plus tetris group) we could run:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njames_data %>%\n  filter(Condition %in% c(\"1\", \"2\")) %>%\n  droplevels() %>% # ignore unused factor levels\n  t.test(intrusions ~ Condition, \n         data = .)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tWelch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  intrusions by Condition\nt = 2.9893, df = 22.632, p-value = 0.006627\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and group 2 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.990331 5.454113\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 1 mean in group 2 \n       5.111111        1.888889 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nBecause `Condition` has four levels, we cannot just specify `intrustion ~ Condition` because a t-test compares two groups and it would not know which of the four to compare so first we have to filter the data and use a new function `droplevels()`. It's important to remember that when it comes to R there are two things to consider, the data you can see and the underlying structure of that data. In the above code we use `filter()` to select only conditions 1 and 2 so that we can compare them. However, that does not change the fact that R \"knows\" that `Condition` has four levels - it does not matter if two of those levels do not have any observations any more, the underlying structure still says there are four groups. `droplevels()` tells R to remove any unused levels from a factor. Try running the above code but without `droplevels()` and see what happens.\n:::\n\nHowever, a quicker and better way of doing this that allows you apply a correction for multiple comparisons easily is to use `emmeans()` which computes all possible pairwise comparison t-tests and applies a correction to the p-value. \n\nFirst, we use `emmeans()` to run the comparisons and then we can pull out the contrasts and use `tidy()` to make it easier to work with. \n\nRun the code below. Which conditions are significantly different from each other? Are any of the comparisons different from the ones reported in the paper now that a correction for multiple comparisons has been applied?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod_pairwise <-emmeans(mod, \n                       pairwise ~ Condition, \n                       adjust = \"bonferroni\")\n\nmod_contrasts <- mod_pairwise$contrasts %>% \n  tidy()\n\nmod_contrasts\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|term      |contrast                | null.value|   estimate| std.error| df|  statistic| adj.p.value|\n|:---------|:-----------------------|----------:|----------:|---------:|--:|----------:|-----------:|\n|Condition |Condition1 - Condition2 |          0|  3.2222222|  1.058604| 68|  3.0438406|   0.0199179|\n|Condition |Condition1 - Condition3 |          0|  1.2222222|  1.058604| 68|  1.1545602|   1.0000000|\n|Condition |Condition1 - Condition4 |          0|  0.2777778|  1.058604| 68|  0.2624001|   1.0000000|\n|Condition |Condition2 - Condition3 |          0| -2.0000000|  1.058604| 68| -1.8892804|   0.3787128|\n|Condition |Condition2 - Condition4 |          0| -2.9444444|  1.058604| 68| -2.7814405|   0.0419783|\n|Condition |Condition3 - Condition4 |          0| -0.9444444|  1.058604| 68| -0.8921602|   1.0000000|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nThe inquisitive among you may have noticed that `mod` is a list of 5 and seemingly contains the same thing three times: `anova_table`, `aov` and `Anova`. The reasons behind the differences are too complex to go into detail on this course (see The R Companion [website here](https://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/d_04.html) for more information) but the simple version is that `anova_table` and `Anova` use one method of calculating the results (type 3 sum of squares) and `aov` uses a different method (type 1 sum of squares). What's important for your purposes is that you need to use `anova_table` to view the overall results (and replicate the results from papers) and `aov`to run the follow-up tests and to get access to the residuals (or `lm()` for factorial ANOVA). As always, precision and attention to detail is key.\n:::\n\n### Activity 7 - Power and effect sizes {#anova-a9}\n\nFinally, we can replicate their power analysis using `pwr.anova.test`from the <pkg>pwr</pkg> package. \n\n> On the basis of the effect size of d = 1.14 from Experiment 1, we assumed a large effect size of f = 0.4.

You have now covered how to run a one-way ANOVA using the <pkg>afex</pkg> package. Linear regression models are great for their flexibility, but it is not always simple for expressing a design with several levels. Combining <pkg>afex</pkg> and <pkg>emmeans</pkg> is a powerful combination when you have categorical independent variables / predictors with several levels. \n\nIn the next chapter, we will extend this to when you have multiple independent variables and you want to investigate the interaction between them for how they affect your dependent variable / outcome. \n",
