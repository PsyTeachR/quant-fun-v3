At the start of Research Methods 2, we then started to explore ANOVA models to handle more complex designs. \n\nIn this chapter, we end the core content on learning how to apply and interpret multiple regression models. This uses the full flexibility of the general linear model to express more complicated designs where you have multiple predictors or interactions between predictors. \n\n**Chapter Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)**\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n\n- Apply and interpret multiple linear regression models. \n\n- Interpret coefficients from individual predictors and interactions. \n\n- Visualise interactions as model predictions to understand and communicate your findings. \n\n- Calculate statistical power for a multiple regression model. \n\n## Chapter preparation\n\n### Introduction to the data set \n\nFor this chapter, we are using open data from @przybylski_large-scale_2017. The abstract of their article is:\n\n> Although the time adolescents spend with digital technologies has sparked widespread concerns that their use might be negatively associated with mental well-being, these potential deleterious influences have not been rigorously studied. Using a preregistered plan for analyzing data collected from a representative sample of English adolescents (n = 120,115), we obtained evidence that the links between digital-screen time and mental well-being are described by quadratic functions. Further, our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are used (i.e., weekday vs. weekend), suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world. The findings inform recommendations for limiting adolescents’ technology use and provide a template for conducting rigorous investigations into the relations between digital technology and children’s and adolescents’ health.\n\nIn summary, this was a large-scale study that found support for the \"Goldilocks\" hypothesis among adolescents: that there is a \"just right\" amount of screen time, such that any amount more or less than this amount is associated with lower well-being. This was a huge survey study: the data contain responses from over 120,000 participants! In this chapter, we will look at whether the relationship between screen time and well-being is moderated by participants' (self-reported) gender.\n\nThe outcome/dependant variable used in the study was the [Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/platform/wemwbs/). This is a 14-item scale with 5 response categories, summed together to form a single score ranging from 14-70.\n\n@przybylski_large-scale_2017 looked at multiple measures of screen time, but we will be focusing on smartphone use.  They found that decrements in well-being started to appear when respondents reported more than one hour of weekly smartphone use. Our research question is: Does the negative association between hours of use and well-being (beyond the one-hour point) differ for boys and girls?\n\n### Organising your files and project for the chapter\n\nBefore we can get started, you need to organise your files and project for the chapter, so your working directory is in order.\n\n1. In your folder for research methods and the book `ResearchMethods1_2/Quant_Fundamentals`, create a new folder called `Chapter_14_multiple_regression`. Within `Chapter_14_multiple_regression`, create two new folders called `data` and `figures`.\n\n2. Create an R Project for `Chapter_14_multiple_regression` as an existing directory for your chapter folder. This should now be your working directory.\n\n3. Create a new R Markdown document and give it a sensible title describing the chapter, such as `14 Multiple Regression`. Delete everything below line 10 so you have a blank file to work with and save the file in your `Chapter_14_multiple_regression` folder. \n\n4. For this chapter, there are three data files you need. Please save the following files: \n\n    - [Przybylski_2017_participants.csv](data/Przybylski_2017_participants.csv). \n    \n    - [Przybylski_2017_screentime.csv](data/Przybylski_2017_screentime.csv)\n    \n    - [Przybylski_2017_wellbeing.csv](data/Przybylski_2017_wellbeing.csv)\n\nRight click the link and select \"save link as\", or clicking the link will save the files to your Downloads. Make sure that you save the files as \".csv\". Save or copy the files to your `data/` folder within `Chapter_14_multiple_regression`.\n\nYou are now ready to start working on the chapter! \n\n### Activity 1 - Load the packages and read the data {#mulregression-a1}\n\nAs the first activity, try and test yourself by completing the following task list.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\nTo prepare for wrangling the data, complete the following tasks: \n\n1. Load the following packages (one of these is new, so revisit [Chapter 1](#install-tidy) if you need a refresher of installing R packages, but remember not to install packages on the university computers / online server):\n\n    - <pkg>pwr</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>sjPlot</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>performance</pkg>\n    \n    - <pkg>tidyverse</pkg>\n\n2.

Use functions like `glimpse()` to look at what the data frames contain. \n\n- The `pinfo` data has information on the participant's background. \n\n- The `wellbeing` data has information from the well-being questionnaire.\n\n- The `screen` data has information about screen time use on weekends (variables ending with `we`) and weekdays (variables ending with `wk`) for four types of activities: \n\n    - Using a computer (variables starting with `Comph`; Q10 on the survey)\n    \n    - Playing video games (variables starting with `Comp`; Q9 on the survey)\n    \n    - Using a smartphone (variables starting with `Smart`; Q11 on the survey)\n    \n    - Watching TV (variables starting with `Watch`; Q8 on the survey).  \n    \nIf you want more information about these variables, look at the items 8-11 on pages 4-5 of the the [PDF version of the survey on the authors' OSF project](https://osf.io/82ybd/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nOnce you have explored the objects, try and answer the following questions: \n\n- The variable corresponding to **gender** is located in the object named <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>pinfo</option><option value=''>wellbeing</option><option value=''>screen</option></select> and this variable is called <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='6' data-answer='[\"male\"]'/>.\n\n- The well-being data is in <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>long</option><option value='answer'>wide</option></select> format and contains observations from <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='10' data-answer='[\"102580\",\"102,580\"]'/> participants on <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='2' data-answer='[\"14\"]'/> items.\n\n- Individual participants in this data set are identified by the variable called <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='9' data-answer='[\"Serial\"]'/>. This variable will allow us to link information across the three tables.\n\n- If you run the function `summary()` on the three data sets, are there any missing data points? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Yes</option><option value='answer'>No</option></select>\n\n### Activity 3 - Compute the well-being score for each respondent {#mulregression-a3}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\nThe WEMWBS well-being score is simply the **sum** of all the items. \n\nWrangle the data to create a new table called `wemwbs`. The data should have two variables: \n\n- `Serial` - the participant ID.\n\n- `total_wellbeing` - the total WEMWBS score.\n\nThink about what wrangling steps you need to apply to achieve this. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"} \n#### Show me some hints\n\n- Gather the data and pivot from wide to long.\n\n- Group the data by a variable.\n\n- Summarise the data to calculate the sum score per participant. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwemwbs <- wellbeing %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = WBOptimf:WBCheer,\n               names_to = \"var\", \n               values_to = \"score\") %>%\n  group_by(Serial) %>%\n  summarise(total_wellbeing = sum(score))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFor a sanity check, verify for yourself that the scores all fall in the 14-70 range. @przybylski_large-scale_2017 reported a mean of 47.52 with a standard deviation of 9.55.

We can plot the relationship between well-being and hours of technology use, split into four categories of technology (video games, computers, smartphones, TV).\n\nFor this step, we are going to give you the code as there are a few new functions we have not taught you about. Make sure as you type the code to question what each line of the code is doing. The functions might be unfamiliar but you should be able to follow what it is doing. We are working with many rows here, so the code might take longer to run than you are used to. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Pivot the screen data longer\n# Separate the variable into the category and day of the week\n# Recode the new variables \nscreen_long <- screen %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = Comph_we:Watch_wk,\n               names_to = \"var\", \n               values_to = \"hours\") %>%\n  separate(col = var, # split variable name\n           into = c(\"variable\", \"day\"), # split into two components\n           sep = \"_\") %>%  # split when it sees a _\n  mutate(variable = case_match(variable,\n                               \"Watch\" ~ \"Watching TV\",\n                               \"Comp\" ~ \"Playing Video Games\",\n                               \"Comph\" ~ \"Using Computers\",\n                               \"Smart\" ~ \"Using Smartphone\"),\n         day = case_match(day,\n                          \"wk\" ~ \"Weekday\",\n                          \"we\" ~ \"Weekend\"))\n\n# Join the two data sets together \n# group by three variables\n# calculate the mean well-being score\ndat_means <- wemwbs %>% \n  inner_join(screen_long, \n             by = \"Serial\") %>%\n  group_by(variable, \n           day, \n           hours) %>%\n  summarise(mean_wellbeing = mean(total_wellbeing))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe now have data at the group level rather than per participant. Each row of `dat_means` is a value for mean well-being split by each level of variable (technology type), day (weekday or weekend), and hours of technology use. If you run the following code, we get a line graph showing the relationship split between technology type and day. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_means %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hours, y = mean_wellbeing, linetype = day)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, nrow = 2) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  labs(x = \"Hours of Technology Use\",\n       y = \"Mean Well-Being Score\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14-multiple-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe graph shows that smartphone use of more than 1 hour per day is associated with increasingly negative well-being.  Note that we have combined the tables using an `inner_join()`, such that we only include data for which we have observations across the `wemwbs` and `screen_long` tables.\n\nIn the next step, we are going to focus on the smartphone/well-being relationship for our multiple linear regression demonstration.\n\n## Multiple linear regression {#mulregression-a5}\n\nNow that we have explored the data, we can start preparing for the analysis. Note that in this analysis, we have:\n\n- A continuous$^*$ outcome: well-being.\n\n- One continuous$^*$ predictor: screen time.\n\n- One categorical predictor: gender.\n\n$^*$these variables are only quasi-continuous as only discrete values are possible. This returns up to the ordinal dilemma, particularly for the outcome of well-being. However, there are a sufficient number of discrete values that we can treat them as effectively continuous.\n\nWe want to estimate two slopes relating screen time to well-being, one for girls and one for boys, and then statistically compare these slopes. So, this problem seems simultaneously like a situation where you would run a regression (to estimate the slopes) but also one where you would need a t-test (to compare two groups). This is the power of regression models as you can look at the interaction between one continuous and one categorical predictor, something that is not possible in factorial ANOVA.\n\n### Activity 5 - Complete the final wrangling steps\n\nFor this analysis, we are going to average weekday and weekend use for smartphones. We need one final round of wrangling to prepare for creating a multiple linear regression model. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\n**Step 1.** Create a new data object `smarttot` that has the mean number of hours per day of smartphone use for each participant, averaged over weekends/weekdays. Then filter the data to only include those who use a smart phone for more than one hour per day. \n\nTo do this, you will need to: \n\n- Filter the data `screen_long` to **only** include smartphone use and not other technologies. \n\n- Group the results by the participant ID (`Serial`). \n\n- Summarise the data to calculate the mean number of hours per participant. Call this variable `total_hours`. \n\n- Filter the data to only include participants who use a smartphone for more than 1 hour per day. \n\nThe data `smarttot` should have two variables: `Serial` (the participant) and `total_hours`.\n\n**Step 2.** Once you have `smarttot`, combine (join) this data object with the information in `wemwbs` and `pinfo`. Call this new object `smart_wb`. This is the final object you need for the multiple linear regression model. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmarttot <- screen_long %>%\n  filter(variable == \"Using Smartphone\") %>%\n  group_by(Serial) %>%\n  summarise(total_hours = mean(hours)) %>% \n  filter(total_hours > 1)\n\nsmart_wb <- smarttot %>%\n  inner_join(wemwbs, \n             by = \"Serial\") %>%\n  inner_join(pinfo, \n             by = \"Serial\") \n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 6 - Mean-centering variables {#mulregression-a6}\n\nAs we discussed in the course materials, when you have continuous variables in a regression model, it is often sensible to transform them by **mean centering**. We covered this in Chapter 8, but it is particularly important in multiple linear regression. You mean center a predictor `X` by subtracting the mean of the predictor (`X_centered = X - mean(X)`). This has two useful consequences:\n\n- The model intercept reflects the prediction for $Y$ at the mean value of the predictor variable, rather than at the zero value of the unscaled variable.\n\n- If there are interactions in the model, any lower-order effects can be given the same interpretation as they receive in ANOVA (main effects, rather than simple effects).\n\nFor categorical predictors with two levels, these become coded as -.5 and .5 (because the mean of these two values is 0).\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\nUse `mutate()` to add two new variables to `smart_wb`: \n\n- `total_hours_c`: calculated as a mean-centered version of the `total_hours` predictor\n\n- `male_c`: recoded as -.5 for female and .5 for male, and then converts both `male` and `male_c` as factors, so that R knows not to treat them as real numbers.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmart_wb <- smart_wb %>%\n  mutate(total_hours_c = total_hours - mean(total_hours),\n         male_c = case_when(male == 1 ~ .5, \n                            male == 0 ~ -.5),\n         male_c = as.factor(male_c),\n         male = as.factor(male))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 7 - Running the regression {#mulregression-a8}\n\nFor the data in `smart_wb`, use the `lm()` function to calculate the multiple regression model:\n\n$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i}  + \\beta_2 X_{2i}  + \\beta_3 X_{3i} + e_i$\n\nwhere\n\n- $Y_i$ is the well-being score for participant $i$;\n\n- $X_{1i}$ is the mean-centered smartphone use variable for participant $i$;\n\n- $X_{2i}$ is gender (-.5 = female, .5 = male);\n\n- $X_{3i}$ is the interaction between smartphone use and gender ($= X_{1i} \\times X_{2i}$)\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\nSave your model to the object `ml_model`. \n\nSave the `summary()` of your model to the object `model_summary`. \n\nPrint the `model_summary` to see the results and answer the following questions:\n\n- The interaction between smartphone use and gender is shown by the variable <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>thours_c</option><option value=''>male_c</option><option value='answer'>thours_c:male_c</option></select>, and this interaction was <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>significant</option><option value=''>non-significant</option></select> at the $\\alpha = .05$ level.\n\n- To 2 decimal places, adjusted $R^2$ suggests the overall model explains what percentage of the variance in well-being scores? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='4' data-answer='[\"9.38\"]'/>\n\n- The *p*-value for the overall model fit is `<2e-16`.

We will demonstrate plotting interactions, but for further information and options, see the [online documentation](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/plot_interactions.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nTo plot the interaction, you need the model object (not the summary), specify \"pred\" as the `type` as we want to plot predictions, and add the `terms` you want to plot. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_model(ml_model, \n           type = \"pred\", \n           terms = c(\"total_hours_c\", \"male_c\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14-multiple-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat is the most reasonable interpretation of the interaction? \n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_PRXKXBHNVO'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRXKXBHNVO\" value=\"\"></input> <span>smartphone use harms girls more than boys</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRXKXBHNVO\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>smartphone use was more negatively associated with wellbeing for girls than for boys</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRXKXBHNVO\" value=\"\"></input> <span>there is no evidence for gender differences in the relationship between smartphone use and well-being</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRXKXBHNVO\" value=\"\"></input> <span>smartphone use harms boys more than girls</span></label></div>\n\n\nThis is fine for helping you to interpret your model, but you would need to customise it before adding it into a report. Like `afex_plot()` we introduced you to in Chapter 13, `plot_model()` uses <pkg>ggplot2</pkg> in the background. You can add further customisation by adding layers after the initial function. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSince `plot_model()` uses <pkg>ggplot2</pkg>, you can use `ggsave()` to save your plots and insert them into your work. \n:::\n\nFor example, we can tidy up the axis labels and remove the title, and set a theme. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_model(ml_model, \n           type = \"pred\", \n           terms = c(\"total_hours_c\", \"male_c\")) + \n  labs(x = \"Total Hours Smartphone Use\",\n       y = \"Total Well-Being Score\",\n       title = \"\") + \n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14-multiple-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor communicating interactions, it is normally better to plot a version using the raw predictors instead of the mean centered versions as the interaction does not change and it will be easier for your readers to understand. \n\n### Activity 9 - Assumption checking {#mulregression-a9}\n\nNow it's time to test those pesky assumptions. The assumptions for multiple regression are the same as simple regression but there is one additional assumption, that of multicollinearity. This is the idea that predictor variables should not be too highly correlated.\n\n1. The outcome/DV is a interval/ratio level data.\n\n2. The predictor variable is interval/ratio or categorical (with two levels).\n\n3. All values of the outcome variable are independent (i.e., each score should come from a different participant). \n\n4. The predictors have non-zero variance.\n\n5. The relationship between outcome and predictor is linear.\n\n6. The residuals should be normally distributed.\n\n7. There should be homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance, but for the residuals).\n\n8. Multicollinearity: predictor variables should not be too highly correlated.\n\nFrom the work we have done so far, we know that we meet assumptions 1 - 4 and we can use the `plot()` function for diagnostic plots, plus `check_model()` from the <pkg>performance</pkg> package. \n\nOne difference from when we used `check_model()` previously is that rather than just letting it run all the tests it wants, we are going to specify which tests to stop it throwing an error. A word of warning - these assumption tests will take longer than usual to run because it's such a big data set. The first line of code will run the assumption tests and save it to an object, calling the object name will then display the plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nassumptions <- check_model(ml_model, \n                           check = c(\"vif\", \n                                     \"qq\", \n                                     \"normality\", \n                                     \"linearity\", \n                                     \"homogeneity\"))\n\nassumptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Assumption plots from the performance package.](14-multiple-regression_files/figure-html/fig-assumption-plots-1.png){#fig-assumption-plots fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor assumption 5, linearity, we already know from looking at the scatterplot that the relationship is linear, but the residual plot also confirms this.\n\nFor assumption 6, normality of residuals, the residuals look good in both plots and this provides an excellent example of why it's often better to visualise than rely on statistics. With a sample size this large, any statistical diagnostic tests will be highly significant as they are sensitive to sample size.\n\nFor assumption 7, homoscedasticity, the plot is missing the reference line. Fun fact, this took us several days of our lives and asking for help on social media to figure out. The reason the line is not there is because the data set is so large that is creates a memory issue. However, if you use the `plot()` version, it does show the reference line.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(ml_model,\n     which = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14-multiple-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is not perfect, but the reference line is roughly flat to suggest there are no serious issues with homoscedasticity. \n\nFinally, for assumption 8, multicollinearity, the plot also indicates no issues but we can also test this statistically using `check_collinearity()` to produce VIF (variance inflation factor) and tolerance values.\n\nEssentially, this function estimates how much the variance of a coefficient is “inflated” because of linear dependence with other predictors, i.e., that a predictor is not actually adding any unique variance to the model, it's just really strongly related to other predictors. [You can read more about this online](https://statisticalhorizons.com/multicollinearity){target=\"_blank\"}. Thankfully, VIF is not affected by large samples like other statistical diagnostic tests.\n\nThere are various rules of thumb, but most converge on a VIF of above 2 - 2.5 for any one predictor being problematic.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_collinearity(ml_model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|Term                 |      VIF| VIF_CI_low| VIF_CI_high| SE_factor| Tolerance| Tolerance_CI_low| Tolerance_CI_high|\n|:--------------------|--------:|----------:|-----------:|---------:|---------:|----------------:|-----------------:|\n|total_hours_c        | 1.721968|   1.704219|    1.740165|  1.312238| 0.5807308|        0.5746582|         0.5867789|\n|male_c               | 1.035552|   1.028488|    1.044369|  1.017621| 0.9656682|        0.9575159|         0.9723014|\n|total_hours_c:male_c | 1.716349|   1.698683|    1.734463|  1.310095| 0.5826319|        0.5765474|         0.5886915|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Activity 10 - Power and effect sizes {#mulregression-a10}\n\nFinally, we will calculate power and an effect size specific to multiple linear regression. Your coefficients represent the effect size for individual variables, but you can summarise the whole regression model with $R^2$ and $f^2$. \n\nUsing your understanding of power analysis from Chapter 10 and the function specific to regression models, calculate the minimum effect size we could reliably observe given our sample size and design but for 99% power and 5% alpha. \n\nHint: for `v`, it is the sample size minus u minus 1 (`N` - `u` - `1`)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npwr.f2.test(u = ?, \n            v = ?, \n            f2 = NULL, \n            sig.level = ?, \n            power = ?)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo 2 decimals, what is the value of $f^2$ the study would be sensitive to? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='0.00' data-answer='[\".00\"]'/>\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npwr.f2.test(u = 3, \n            v = 71029, \n            f2 = NULL, \n            sig.level = .05, \n            power = .99)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n     Multiple regression power calculation \n\n              u = 3\n              v = 71029\n             f2 = 0.0003673651\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.99\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe study was incredibly sensitive, where they would detect effects of $f^2$ = .0004 with 99% power.\n:::\n\nThe effect size $f^2$ is a kind of transformed version of $R^2$.

First, copy and paste the code below into **white-space** in your R Markdown document and then knit.

The progress that you have made is truly astonishing. Even if you struggled with R/RStudio and have not quite understood every single line of code, what you are capable of with data wrangling and visualisation alone makes you some of the most highly competitive psychology graduates in the world. Try and think of everything you have learnt from week 1 of Research Methods 1 to now. Hopefully, you have proved to yourself you can do this. \n\nRegardless of whether you continue with quantitative methods and using R/RStudio, remember the more important critical skills that you have learned as part of this process. The next time you see a data set or you see data being talked about in the news, think about all the work that was put into getting the data into the final format. More importantly, think about all the decisions that the researcher needed to make along the way and how that might have affected the outcome. \n",
